# Pluto.TV Volume Slider for Chromecast

Pluto.TV is a great app to make the most out of your Chromecast device!
However, the web interface does not include a control for adjusting the
volume.

This Chrome extension adds a simple slider to the video player, allowing
you to set the volume of your Chromecast.
